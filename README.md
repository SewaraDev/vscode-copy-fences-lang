# 📂 Copy Folder Content VSCode Extension 📋

🚀 This is a Visual Studio Code (VSCode) extension that allows you to easily copy the content of a selected folder into your clipboard. You can choose to copy content with or without a suffix.

## Why This Extension?

This extension simplifies the process of referencing multiple file types simultaneously, promoting a more efficient way to prompt language learning models such as ChatGPT.

## Features 💡

When you right-click on a folder in your explorer panel, you'll see two options: "Copy Folder Content" and "Copy Folder Content With Suffix". Clicking on these options will read all files in the folder and copy their content, optionally along with a user-defined suffix, into your clipboard, ready for you to paste anywhere you like.

## Settings 🔧

- `copy-folder-content.suffix`: Suffix to append after the copied folder content when using the "Copy Folder Content With Suffix" command. Default is an empty string.

## Installation 🔧

2. Press `Ctrl+P` to open the quick open dialog
3. Type `ext install copy-folder-content` and hit enter
4. Reload Visual Studio Code
